# Text-Analysis-and-visualization

The dataset used is available here - 
One StackExchange site dealing with topics that I found interesting was choosen from https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#traffic for a list. In this project, I choose a StackExchange site dealing with topic I found interesting to visualize in different ways and use Quarto file to generate a report. The StackExchange site that was choosen here is Computational Science or provided as SciComp.StackExchange. We downloaded the public data dump file which were in XML and turned them to CSV format for further workings.

At least five nontrivial data visualisations and/or tables, at least three of which are based on the extraction of information from text (e.g., tags, keywords, locations, etc.) was created.
